# Processing3 Mods

Built for Processing 3, these Mods are pieces of Java code with inputs 
and outputs that can be connected. For a detailed description, see
README.pdf in this dir.

## Location

You may be able to install this through the Processing IDE.
It would end up your "sketchbook location",
also sometimes called the "processing library directory".
You can find its location in the Processing app, in the menu,
under preferences. It's usually in your homedir somewhere.

Or you can downlaod it from here, and put it there yourself.
