# Processing3 Mods

Built for Processing 3, these Mods are pieces of Java code with inputs 
and outputs that can be interconnected. For a detailed description, see
https://commonpike.github.io/nl.kw.processing.mods/reference/ProcessingMods.pdf

## Installation

You may be able to install this through the Processing IDE.
It should end up your "sketchbook location",
also sometimes called the "processing library directory".
You can find its location in the Processing app, in the menu,
under preferences. It's usually in your homedir somewhere.

Or you can download it from GIT, and put it in that folder
yourself: 
https://github.com/commonpike/nl.kw.processing.mods

Once it's there, choose 'sketch > import library'
from the menu bar.

## Folder structure

```
- library
    The only folder you need, containing the jar file
- README.md 
    This file
- dist
    Distribution files; an HTML summary, an introduction PDF, and possibly the ZIP
- reference
    Javadocs
- src
    Java source files
- build
    Compiled java classes
- bin
    Some goodies I use for maintenance
```
